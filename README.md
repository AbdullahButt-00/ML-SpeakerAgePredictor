# ML-SpeakerAgePredictor
Predicting speaker age from audio recordings using regression and Classification models.
This project predicts a speaker's age using acoustic features extracted from audio recordings. The model is trained using a regression approach.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- The dataset includes audio files and metadata containing speaker ages, gender, and accents.
- Features extracted: Pitch, Formant Frequencies, Intensity, Duration, Spectral Features.

## ðŸš€ Project Steps
1. **Feature Extraction** (Librosa, Python Speech Features)
2. **Data Preprocessing** (Handling missing values, normalization)
3. **Model Training** (Regression models like Linear, Decision Tree)
4. **Model Evaluation** (MSE, MAE, RÂ² score)
5. **git clone:** https://github.com/AbdullahButt-00/ML-SpeakerAgePredictor.git
6. pip install -r requirements.txt


## ðŸ“œ Instructions
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
- Run `AI.ipynb` to execute feature extraction and training.
